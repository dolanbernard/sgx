## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

- `verify_nonce()`: `mc_sgx_dcap_types::Quote3` can verify a nonce matches that
  which was provided in a `mc_sgx_core_types::ReportData`.
- `mc-sgx-dcap-types::QuoteHeader` rust wrapper around `sgx_quote_header_t`

### Changed

- `mc_sgx_dcap_types::Quote3Error` was renamed to `mc_sgx_dcap_types::QlError`
  to better indicate it's an error coming from the SGX quote library SDK.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-10-20

### Changed

- Add `mc_sgx_tservice::SealError`, make `SealedBuilder` use it instead of
  `mc_sgx_core_types::Error`.
- `mc-sgx-dcap-ql::set_path` and `mc-sgx-dcap-ql::load_policy` have been
  replaced with `mc-sgx-dcap-ql::PathInitializer` and
  `mc-sgx-dcap-ql::LoadPolicyInitializer`
- `mc-sgx-dcap-quoteverify::set_path` and
  `mc-sgx-dcap-quoteverify::load_policy` have been replaced
  with `mc-sgx-dcap-quoteverify::PathInitializer` and
  `mc-sgx-dcap-quoteverify::LoadPolicyInitializer`
