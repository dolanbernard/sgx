## License

Look for the *LICENSE* file at the root of the repo for more information.

## Build Instructions

The workspace can be built with `cargo build` and tested with `cargo test`.
Either command will recognize the cargo `--release` flag to build with
optimizations.

The [Intel SGX SDK](#intel-sgx-sdk) needs to be installed.

## Intel SGX SDK

See <https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx#build-the-intelr-sgx-sdk-and-intelr-sgx-psw-package>
for installation instructions.

The environment variable `SGX_SDK` can be used to specify where the SDK is
installed. When unset the location will default to `/opt/intel/sgxsdk`

## Features

When no features are present the SGX software simulation libraries will be
linked in. When the `hw` feature is present the hardware SGX libraries will be
linked in.
